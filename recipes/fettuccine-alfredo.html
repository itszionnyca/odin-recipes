            <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>Prepare the Kitchen</li></strong>
            <ul><li>Get 1 stick of butter</li>
                <li>1 spoonful of minced garlic</li>
                <li>Non-stick saucepan</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>Heat saucepan on medium and cut a decent size of butter into the pan. When the ends of the pan bubbles insert the spoonful of
             minced garlic. Give it about 1 min then change the temperature to low.</p>
            
             <strong><li>Slow and Easy Wins the Race</li></strong>
            <ul><li>Grab the can of evaporated milk (can be replaced with either half n half or condensed milk)
                 and pour into the saucepan.</li>
                <li>With the temperature on low, wait until the ends of the pan are slightly bubbling
                    then pour in the bag of parmesan cheese. </li>
                <li>
                    Slightly mix then wait for the cheese to completely melt leaving a creamy texture.
                </li>
            <p><em>The last step might take some time and requires patiences, so while we wait lets prepare our pasta.</em></p>
            </ul>
            <strong><li>Boiling Pasta</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a large pot that's big enough for the amount of pasta noodles you desire.</li>
                <li>Fill <strong>almost completely</strong> with water.<em>
                    (keep in mind you still have to be able to fit in all your pasta).</em></li>
                <li>Set temperature to high and boil the water until it's bubbling.</li>
                <li>Throw in a generous amount of salt into the boiling water.</li>
                <li>Place the uncooked pasta into the boiling water, then cover with a top.</li>
                <li>Lower the temperature to medium then wait about 20 mins or until the pasta is floating.</li>
                <li><strong>Stir occasionally</strong> (this is to prevent pasta from sticking).</li>
            </ul>
            <strong><li>Final Touches</li></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once pasta is cooked place all the noodles into the saucepan.</li>
                <li>Mix, evenly distributing the sauce over noodles.</li>
                <li>While mixing add black pepper to your liking, and a little bit of nutmeg.</li>
                <li>Viola, your fettuccine alfredo is ready for serving!</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
